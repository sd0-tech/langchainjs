# Stuff

The stuff documents chain ("stuff" as in "to stuff" or "to fill") is the most straightforward of the document chains. It takes a list of documents, inserts them all into a prompt and passes that prompt to an LLM.

This chain is well-suited for applications where documents are small and only a few are passed in for most calls.

Here's how it looks in practice:

import QAExample from "@examples/chains/question_answering_stuff.ts";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai
```

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{QAExample}</CodeBlock>
