# OpenAI Agent for Chat Models

This example covers how to use an agent that uses OpenAI's Function Calling functionality to pick the tool and args to call. This agent only works with specific OpenAI Chat Models, more information in the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling).
